I am a Robotics M.S.E. student at GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. Nadia Figueroa and Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman. Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I work on scalable learning and planning for general, adaptable robots. I’m interested in building predictive models for decision-making, learning useful abstractions for long-horizon reasoning, and leveraging human data and feedback to improve robustness and generalization.
